This is my repository for my senior thesis (SIP) for Kalamazoo College. My advisors were Dr. Eric Barth and Dr. Rachel Love, and we worked to make educational materials for undergraduate mathematics courses at Kalamazoo College.

The "SIP Final" PDF file contains a written summary of the project, links to the videos made for the project, and a compilation of all documents made for the project.
